Description: Small-scale nearshore fisheries in the United States territories 
  of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American 
  Samoa target reef, bottom, and nearshore pelagic species. These fisheries are 
  of fundamental importance to subsistence fishers, critical in local cultural 
  traditions, and provide a source of income and recreation to the local 
  population. "expalg.cie" was developed to assist the Center of Independent 
  Experts (CIE) review of the expansion algorithm and reproduces the case study 
  presented in the NOAA Tech Memo “Shore-based and boat-based fishing surveys in 
  Guam, the CNMI, and American Samoa: Survey design, expansion algorithm, and a 
  case study”.
